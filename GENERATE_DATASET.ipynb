       "      <td>The Earth's rotation is not regular. It varies a bit, so sometimes we add a second. We do this to ensure that noon is always going to be sometime around mid-day. If we did not add leap seconds, over a very long period of time where the Earth's rotation slowly changed, noon could end up being at dusk. We want to keep 7am in the morning, noon at mid-day, 7pm around evening, etc. Though we have never had one, it's also possible to have a negative leap second. That is, taking away a second from the year. This has never happened, but if the Earth's rotation were to speed up, it could happen. The biggest thing to know about leap seconds is that they can cause computer problems. You might remember the Y2K bug. A leap second can cause similar problems, and they actually have caused problems in the past. The reason for this is that generally we expect a day to have 24 hours, and for time to always move forward. With a leap second this is not true. When writing software, programers try to think of all the possible exceptions that could happen withing their code. For example, the program might expect a word, but instead get a number. A good programmer will check for these exceptions and deal with them. However, a programer can easily forget about leap seconds and not have a fail-safe in their code for when a day have more than 24 hours. When such an exception happens, the program can produce errors or crash. It is an interesting topic, you can read more about it here: URL_0</td>\n",

Those thousandths of a second add up, so every few years we have to slip in an extra second to account for them.

You think to yourself, \"Gee that's a real nice cave, there's just enough room for my rocket car, my crime fighting computer and my superhero costume collection. It'd be perfect for me.\" Let's say that nobody already owns the cave, so you move in and bring in all your stuff. You carve a costume wardrobe into one of the stone walls, grab a shovel and flatten the floor a bit so your rocket car can drive in and out. After you've finished working on the cave and fixing it up you start to think of it as yours. But not everybody agrees. There's another guy a few miles away who also fancies himself a billionaire superhero like you. Flies around in a stupid metal suit that he made himself while a prisoner of the Taliban or something like that. Anyway, one day he walks by and sees your cave and thinks, \"That's a great cave, I should make that my lair.\" So he comes in for a chat. He starts by telling you that he's going to move into your cave because it's his. You tell him to get stuffed, and that if he tries to take it from you, you'll be forced to unwrap a bundle of BAM!, POW! and WHOOF! on him. And what's more, you've recently adopted a teenage boy who'll do the same. \"Yeah?\" says the guy, \"Well if that's how you feel, I'm friends with a cryogenically frozen soldier, a Norse god and some dude who owns a bow and arrow. They'll back me up if I ask them. Your move.\" \"So what?\" you say. \"One of my friends is a super strong refugee from a dying planet, another is a mythical Amazonian warrior and there's also a guy who was electrocuted by lightning while drowning in toxic chemicals. They'll take your friends for sure.\" \"Yeah? We'll see. How fast can your friends be here?\" \"Funny you should ask. There's something I didn't tell you about my friend who got struck by lightning.\" Suddenly a phone rings. It's the other guy's cell. On the phone is a cool, english sounding voice with immense gravitas. \"Forget the cave.\" it says. \"I've spent my life training superhero teams at my private academy, and I'm telling you, your team is outgunned. In any case, nobody else wants a fight over this cave when we should all be working together for the good of mankind. Everyone else has decided the cave is his cause he claimed it first. So walk away.\" This call makes all the difference. The other guy might not be happy, but he leaves you in peace. The cave is yours because a) you claimed it b) you were in a position to defend it and c) everyone else agreed that your claim and ability to defend were substantial enough to recognise your right of ownership.</td>\n",

It varies a bit, so sometimes we add a second. We do this to ensure that noon is always going to be sometime around mid-day. If we did not add leap seconds, over a very long period of time where the Earth's rotation slowly changed, noon could end up being at dusk. We want to keep 7am in the morning, noon at mid-day, 7pm around evening, etc. Though we have never had one, it's also possible to have a negative leap second. That is, taking away a second from the year. This has never happened, but if the Earth's rotation were to speed up, it could happen. The biggest thing to know about leap seconds is that they can cause computer problems. You might remember the Y2K bug. A leap second can cause similar problems, and they actually have caused problems in the past. The reason for this is that generally we expect a day to have 24 hours, and for time to always move forward. With a leap second this is not true. When writing software, programers try to think of all the possible exceptions that could happen withing their code. For example, the program might expect a word, but instead get a number. A good programmer will check for these exceptions and deal with them.

If you multiply 24 hours by 60 minutes by 60 seconds, you find that there are 86400 seconds per day. The problem is that our definition of the second is based on [an average that is a century old.]( URL_0 ) In modern times, the average day is about 2 thousandths of a second longer—again, because of Earth's slowing rotation. Those thousandths of a second add up, so every few years we have to slip in an extra second to account for them. Without leap seconds, we'd eventually end up with noon at 7 o'clock, though admittedly, this would take a very long time.   \n",
       "3  Imagine you are out walking in the woods near your house and you find a cave. You think to yourself, \"Gee that's a real nice cave, there's just enough room for my rocket car, my crime fighting computer and my superhero costume collection. It'd be perfect for me.\" Let's say that nobody already owns the cave, so you move in and bring in all your stuff. You carve a costume wardrobe into one of the stone walls, grab a shovel and flatten the floor a bit so your rocket car can drive in and out. After you've finished working on the cave and fixing it up you start to think of it as yours. But not everybody agrees. There's another guy a few miles away who also fancies himself a billionaire superhero like you. Flies around in a stupid metal suit that he made himself while a prisoner of the Taliban or something like that. Anyway, one day he walks by and sees your cave and thinks, \"That's a great cave, I should make that my lair.\" So he comes in for a chat. He starts by telling you that he's going to move into your cave because it's his. You tell him to get stuffed, and that if he tries to take it from you, you'll be forced to unwrap a bundle of BAM!, POW! and WHOOF! on him. And what's more, you've recently adopted a teenage boy who'll do the same. \"Yeah?\" says the guy, \"Well if that's how you feel, I'm friends with a cryogenically frozen soldier, a Norse god and some dude who owns a bow and arrow. They'll back me up if I ask them. Your move.\" \"So what?\" you say. \"One of my friends is a super strong refugee from a dying planet, another is a mythical Amazonian warrior and there's also a guy who was electrocuted by lightning while drowning in toxic chemicals. They'll take your friends for sure.\" \"Yeah? We'll see. How fast can your friends be here?\" \"Funny you should ask. There's something I didn't tell you about my friend who got struck by lightning.\" Suddenly a phone rings. It's the other guy's cell. On the phone is a cool, english sounding voice with immense gravitas. \"Forget the cave.\" it says. \"I've spent my life training superhero teams at my private academy, and I'm telling you, your team is outgunned. In any case, nobody else wants a fight over this cave when we should all be working together for the good of mankind. Everyone else has decided the cave is his cause he claimed it first. So walk away.\" This call makes all the difference. The other guy might not be happy, but he leaves you in peace. The cave is yours because a) you claimed it b) you were in a position to defend it and c) everyone else agreed that your claim and ability to defend were substantial enough to recognise your right of ownership.   \n",

If we did not add leap seconds, over a very long period of time where the Earth's rotation slowly changed, noon could end up being at dusk. We want to keep 7am in the morning, noon at mid-day, 7pm around evening, etc. Though we have never had one, it's also possible to have a negative leap second. That is, taking away a second from the year. This has never happened, but if the Earth's rotation were to speed up, it could happen. The biggest thing to know about leap seconds is that they can cause computer problems. You might remember the Y2K bug. A leap second can cause similar problems, and they actually have caused problems in the past. The reason for this is that generally we expect a day to have 24 hours, and for time to always move forward. With a leap second this is not true. When writing software, programers try to think of all the possible exceptions that could happen withing their code. For example, the program might expect a word, but instead get a number. A good programmer will check for these exceptions and deal with them. However, a programer can easily forget about leap seconds and not have a fail-safe in their code for when a day have more than 24 hours.

The problem is that our definition of the second is based on [an average that is a century old.]( URL_0 ) In modern times, the average day is about 2 thousandths of a second longer—again, because of Earth's slowing rotation. Those thousandths of a second add up, so every few years we have to slip in an extra second to account for them. Without leap seconds, we'd eventually end up with noon at 7 o'clock, though admittedly, this would take a very long time.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Imagine you are out walking in the woods near your house and you find a cave. You think to yourself, \"Gee that's a real nice cave, there's just enough room for my rocket car, my crime fighting computer and my superhero costume collection. It'd be perfect for me.\" Let's say that nobody already owns the cave, so you move in and bring in all your stuff. You carve a costume wardrobe into one of the stone walls, grab a shovel and flatten the floor a bit so your rocket car can drive in and out. After you've finished working on the cave and fixing it up you start to think of it as yours. But not everybody agrees. There's another guy a few miles away who also fancies himself a billionaire superhero like you. Flies around in a stupid metal suit that he made himself while a prisoner of the Taliban or something like that. Anyway, one day he walks by and sees your cave and thinks, \"That's a great cave, I should make that my lair.\" So he comes in for a chat. He starts by telling you that he's going to move into your cave because it's his. You tell him to get stuffed, and that if he tries to take it from you, you'll be forced to unwrap a bundle of BAM!, POW! and WHOOF! on him. And what's more, you've recently adopted a teenage boy who'll do the same. \"Yeah?\" says the guy, \"Well if that's how you feel, I'm friends with a cryogenically frozen soldier, a Norse god and some dude who owns a bow and arrow. They'll back me up if I ask them. Your move.\" \"So what?\" you say. \"One of my friends is a super strong refugee from a dying planet, another is a mythical Amazonian warrior and there's also a guy who was electrocuted by lightning while drowning in toxic chemicals. They'll take your friends for sure.\" \"Yeah? We'll see. How fast can your friends be here?\" \"Funny you should ask. There's something I didn't tell you about my friend who got struck by lightning.\" Suddenly a phone rings. It's the other guy's cell. On the phone is a cool, english sounding voice with immense gravitas. \"Forget the cave.\" it says. \"I've spent my life training superhero teams at my private academy, and I'm telling you, your team is outgunned. In any case, nobody else wants a fight over this cave when we should all be working together for the good of mankind. Everyone else has decided the cave is his cause he claimed it first. So walk away.\" This call makes all the difference. The other guy might not be happy, but he leaves you in peace. The cave is yours because a) you claimed it b) you were in a position to defend it and c) everyone else agreed that your claim and ability to defend were substantial enough to recognise your right of ownership.</td>\n",

It varies a bit, so sometimes we add a second. We do this to ensure that noon is always going to be sometime around mid-day. If we did not add leap seconds, over a very long period of time where the Earth's rotation slowly changed, noon could end up being at dusk. We want to keep 7am in the morning, noon at mid-day, 7pm around evening, etc. Though we have never had one, it's also possible to have a negative leap second. That is, taking away a second from the year. This has never happened, but if the Earth's rotation were to speed up, it could happen. The biggest thing to know about leap seconds is that they can cause computer problems. You might remember the Y2K bug. A leap second can cause similar problems, and they actually have caused problems in the past. The reason for this is that generally we expect a day to have 24 hours, and for time to always move forward. With a leap second this is not true. When writing software, programers try to think of all the possible exceptions that could happen withing their code. For example, the program might expect a word, but instead get a number. A good programmer will check for these exceptions and deal with them. However, a programer can easily forget about leap seconds and not have a fail-safe in their code for when a day have more than 24 hours. When such an exception happens, the program can produce errors or crash. It is an interesting topic, you can read more about it here: URL_0   \n",

If you multiply 24 hours by 60 minutes by 60 seconds, you find that there are 86400 seconds per day. The problem is that our definition of the second is based on [an average that is a century old.]( URL_0 ) In modern times, the average day is about 2 thousandths of a second longer—again, because of Earth's slowing rotation. Those thousandths of a second add up, so every few years we have to slip in an extra second to account for them. Without leap seconds, we'd eventually end up with noon at 7 o'clock, though admittedly, this would take a very long time.   \n",
       "3  Imagine you are out walking in the woods near your house and you find a cave. You think to yourself, \"Gee that's a real nice cave, there's just enough room for my rocket car, my crime fighting computer and my superhero costume collection. It'd be perfect for me.\" Let's say that nobody already owns the cave, so you move in and bring in all your stuff. You carve a costume wardrobe into one of the stone walls, grab a shovel and flatten the floor a bit so your rocket car can drive in and out. After you've finished working on the cave and fixing it up you start to think of it as yours. But not everybody agrees. There's another guy a few miles away who also fancies himself a billionaire superhero like you. Flies around in a stupid metal suit that he made himself while a prisoner of the Taliban or something like that. Anyway, one day he walks by and sees your cave and thinks, \"That's a great cave, I should make that my lair.\" So he comes in for a chat. He starts by telling you that he's going to move into your cave because it's his. You tell him to get stuffed, and that if he tries to take it from you, you'll be forced to unwrap a bundle of BAM!, POW! and WHOOF! on him. And what's more, you've recently adopted a teenage boy who'll do the same. \"Yeah?\" says the guy, \"Well if that's how you feel, I'm friends with a cryogenically frozen soldier, a Norse god and some dude who owns a bow and arrow. They'll back me up if I ask them. Your move.\" \"So what?\" you say. \"One of my friends is a super strong refugee from a dying planet, another is a mythical Amazonian warrior and there's also a guy who was electrocuted by lightning while drowning in toxic chemicals. They'll take your friends for sure.\" \"Yeah? We'll see. How fast can your friends be here?\" \"Funny you should ask. There's something I didn't tell you about my friend who got struck by lightning.\" Suddenly a phone rings. It's the other guy's cell. On the phone is a cool, english sounding voice with immense gravitas. \"Forget the cave.\" it says. \"I've spent my life training superhero teams at my private academy, and I'm telling you, your team is outgunned. In any case, nobody else wants a fight over this cave when we should all be working together for the good of mankind. Everyone else has decided the cave is his cause he claimed it first. So walk away.\" This call makes all the difference. The other guy might not be happy, but he leaves you in peace. The cave is yours because a) you claimed it b) you were in a position to defend it and c) everyone else agreed that your claim and ability to defend were substantial enough to recognise your right of ownership.   \n",

       "top     Great read here. I experienced a very traumatic incident almost two years ago and have felt emotionally numb and have had a weak nervous system ( feel stinging sensations in my body and numbness in my fingers sometimes) I am just wondering if anyone has any therapeutic methods or ways to improve my overal wellbeing and returning to my previous well-being that I really want to feel again. Any reply would help. I've heard meditation, essential oils and exercise in general will help. Sadly, I haven't taken time to do any of those and have therefore not improved how I feel, yet I've been very discontent with how I feel   \n",
